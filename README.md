# Servo Motor Projects


--- 

## Components of this Project

**In this Project there are Two Separate Electrical Circuits:** 

- The first electrical circuit *Servo Motors to Initial Positin Circuit* is designed by connecting an arduino to five servo motors that are programmed to rotate to 90 degrees once the robot is activated. 
- The Secend electrical circuit *Servo Potentiometer Control Circuit* is designed by connecting an arduino to five servo motors, and each servo motor is controlled by a potentiometer.

## Usage of the Project

The two electrical circuits are both used in the robot arm. Each servo motor is used in each joint of the arm, starting from the base and ending with the gripper.

## How to Use/Download the Files

Each circuit has four files, two files out of the four are images of the circuit (before and after the simulation). The file in `ino` format shows the code used to program the circuit. The final file which is in `brd` format shows the full circuit that is designed and can be viewed by using TinkerCad.
